    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm 26 years old and I live in Portland, Oregon. I have lived in Oregon my whole life, but I grew up in Eugene specifically.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I run a weekly social partner Blues dance in Portland for Portland Blues & Jazz Dance Society, I go rock climbing, and I play video games. I mostly play Overwatch on the PS4, Beat Saber (which is a VR game on Oculus on my PC that I built), and Killer Queen (which is a 10-player arcade game). I travel around the country to play Killer Queen with friends for fun. Check out the website I built for our local Killer Queen scene if you're curious: <a href="https://killerqueenpdx.buzz" target="_blank">killerqueenpdx.buzz</a></p>
    <p>I have a baby pet Ball Python named Belenus whom I adore. He's a "piebald" morph which means he has sections that are pure white along his body. He's still a baby currently, but he'll eventually get around 5 feet long. He's almost a year and a half old now and he could live to be around 30 years old, so I plan to have him for most of my life.</p>
