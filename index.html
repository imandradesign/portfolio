    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm 26 years old and I live in Portland, Oregon. I have lived in Oregon my whole life, but I grew up in Eugene specifically.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I run a weekly social partner Blues dance in Portland for Portland Blues & Jazz Dance Society, I go rock climbing, and I play video games. I mostly play Overwatch, Beat Saber on my Oculus (Virtual Reality), and Killer Queen (which is a 10-player arcade game). I travel around the country to play Killer Queen with friends for fun. Check out the website I built for our local Killer Queen scene if you're curious: <a href="https://killerqueenpdx.buzz" target="_blank">killerqueenpdx.buzz</a></p>
    <p>I have a baby pet Ball Python named Belenus whom I adore. He's a "piebald" morph which means he has sections that are pure white along his body.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>All of my coding knowledge is self taught, so this is the first in-person class I've attended for programming. I used to be a caregiver for adults with developmental disabilities, but I transitioned away from that 4 years ago when I got my current job at Squarespace as a Customer Care Specialist. I started playing around with websites on the Squarespace platform and teaching myself how to inpect a page and use CSS, and since then I've started learning HTML, Javascript, and Python. I really enjoy problem solving and learning new technical skills, so I'm taking this class to help bridge some of the gaps with my self-taught knowledge and keep moving forward so I can eventually change my career into a more technical position.</p>
